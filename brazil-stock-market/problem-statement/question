Drill-down Query

This query is characterized by providing more detailed aggregation levels for the data. In the context Stock Market, we can use a drill-down query to analyze the differences in the behavior of the average stock value when we analyze the time dimension under different granularities going from the largest grain to the smallest grain (e.g., years, semesters, months). The analysis of different granularities can contribute to the perception of short-, medium- and long-term trends of a stock, and is therefore extremely relevant for investidors in their decision-making on which stock to invest.
